### Acknowledgements

    I'd like to thank my classmates, first and foremost, for putting up with my incessant whining about not knowing enough and being too old or too dumb to learn new things.
    I also consulted at least twenty (I'm not exagerrating) tutorials and countless google searches to be able to make this silly little game. I don't think there is a single original thought in here. Lol
